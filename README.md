# To-Do List App - New Branch

This branch represents a fresh start for the To-Do List App. All previous JavaScript code has been removed, and we're rebuilding the project from the ground up with a cleaner, more modular approach.

---

## Project Overview

The To-Do List App is a simple task manager that allows users to add, track, and delete tasks. In this new branch, the focus is on rethinking the application's architecture to improve maintainability and scalability. This fresh start paves the way for a data-driven approach, better state management, and eventual integration of advanced features.

---

## Objectives for the New Branch

- **Clean Slate:**  
  Remove legacy code to ensure a more maintainable and scalable codebase.

- **Improved Architecture:**  
  Rebuild the core functionality using a modular, data-driven approach (e.g., managing tasks in arrays/objects) which will simplify future enhancements.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Plan to integrate features such as:
  - Data persistence using LocalStorage.
  - Editing task names.
  - Drag & drop reordering.
  - Dark mode toggle.
  - Task filtering (e.g., All, Active, Completed).

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS:** Responsible for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Handles functionality and interactions.
- **LocalStorage (Planned):** Will be used for persisting tasks across sessions.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild Core Functionality:**  
   - Implement basic features: add, complete, and delete tasks.
   - Utilize an array-based data structure to manage tasks.

2. **Integrate Data Persistence:**  
   - Incorporate LocalStorage to save tasks between sessions.

3. **Iterate on Features:**  
   - Once the basics are solid, explore additional enhancements such as editing tasks, reordering, and UI improvements.

4. **Maintain a Modular Codebase:**  
   - Aim for a clean, modular design that makes the app easier to extend and maintain over time.
